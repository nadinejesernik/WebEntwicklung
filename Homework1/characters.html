            <p>Roxas, the Key of Destiny (めぐりあう鍵, lit Serendipitous Key) is the Nobody of Sora, and Rank XIII of Organization XIII. Like Naminé, he was born when Sora released his own heart in order to restore Kairi's. Although Sora's heart was soon restored, Roxas continued to endure and exist, oblivious to Sora's existence for most of his life. He has the ability to use the Keyblade, and wields light, using it to direct rays that strike opponents with great power. He commands the Samurai Nobodies. He strongly resembles Ventus, as Xigbar indirectly references in the Secret Reports.</p>
